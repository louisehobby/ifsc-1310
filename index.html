  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>From the feedback that I collected from my family, peers, and friends, they were amazed with how I could build a working website. My dad was very amazed with how I built it,  since he isn’t very tech savvy. But from the rest of the feedback that I collected, many commented on the colors I used and how it didn’t fit with the space theme of the content presented.</p>
  <p>One of the first noticeable changes I made was the title image from your image to one that I found google. I also changed the tint color on the image, to give it a more nasa/space theme to the overall website and to look more professional. Another change was taking the wufoo form off and only keeping it on the contact page. I took it away because it looked unprofessional on the other pages. I also implemented a slideshow/javascript, like how you showed us in class with the cycle lab, on the contact page below the wufoo form. If I had to start over from the beginning, I would change the pictures and use a larger variety of images. I would also keep the theme and color in mind. Because on my dragon version 1, the theme is brown and pink, those colors look good together, but they don’t go with the theme of space.</p>
  <p>Lastly, I would like to thank you for helping throughout the semester with my simple problems. At the beginning of the semester I didn’t know anything about web technology and had only done one year of graphic design in high school. So, being able to develop a whole website by the end of the year was a huge accomplishment for me.</p>
  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive Enhancement is a strategy that web designers use to emphasize content more than the presentation and clinet slide scripting. It's useful because it allows webdesigners to focus on developing the best version of their website, while mainly focusing on the content section. It's a philosophy in which content is emphasized and additional features are layered. Progressive enhancement is a strategy in web design that puts emphasis on web content first.</p>
